# 摘要

随着互联网金融的快速兴起，小额贷款的规模也在逐年上升，这类资产流动性的问题一直困扰着相关互联网小贷公司，而小贷资产证券化正是国内公司从海外借鉴过来的有效办法。通过小贷资产证券化的方式，小贷公司等同于可以提前获取未来现金流，这对小贷公司有着极大的帮助，因此市面上小贷资产证券化产品层出不穷。但与此同时小贷资产证券化产品的风险不容忽视。其中风险主要是小额贷款作为基础资产所带来的基础资产质量风险，因此需要对行业内较为优秀的小贷资产证券化产品进行分析，从而能够找出其可借鉴之处，为其他同类产品做出参考。

本文首先对小贷资产证券化的风险特点和风险种类进行分类研究。然后本文选择了M小贷公司旗下较为有代表性的一支资产证券化产品作为研究案例，通过风险识别、风险评估和风险控制三个步骤对该资产证券化产品进行分析。研究表明，M小贷资产证券化产品的基础资产池质量较高、原始权益人并无经营风险和混同风险，资产隔离制度完善，信用评级良好，但也存在着流动性不高和现金流预测有偏差的风险。

最后，本文对该M小贷资产证券化产品的优点和缺点进行了总结和归纳，并对M小贷公司提出了相关建议。M小贷资产证券化产品在流动性风险的控制和基础资产相关风险的控制上表现较好，值得同行业其他产品学习借鉴，但M小贷资产证券化产品也存在着未采取外部增信措施和流动性方案相对单一的问题，因此建议M小贷资产证券化产品应不仅采取內部增信措施，也应按需採取相应的外部增信措施来保障投资者收益。另外 M小贷公司应进一步完善资产证券化产品的流动性方案，降低相应的流动性风险。

With the rapid rise of internet finance, the scale of small loans is also increasing year by year. The issue of liquidity of such assets has always troubled related internet small loan companies, and the securitization of small loan assets is an effective method that domestic companies learn from overseas. Through the securitization of small loan assets, small loan companies are equivalent to obtaining future cash flows in advance, which is of great help to small loan companies. Therefore, small loan asset securitization products are constantly emerging in the market. But at the same time, the risks of small loan asset securitization products cannot be ignored. The main risk is the risk brought by small loans as basic assets. So it is necessary to analyze the relatively excellent small loan asset securitization products in the market, in order to identify their standout points and provide reference for other similar products.

Then, this thesis selects a representative asset-backed securities under M Small Loan Company as a research case, and analyzes the asset-backed securities through three steps: risk identification, risk assessment, and risk control. Research has shown that the underlying asset pool quality of M Small Loan Asset Backed Securities is high, the original equity holders have no operational or mixed risk, the asset isolation system is sound, and the credit rating is good. However, there is also a risk of low liquidity and deviation in cash flow forecasts.

Finally, this thesis summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of M Small Loan Asset Backed Securities, and puts forward relevant suggestions for M Small Loan Company. M Small Loan Asset Backed Securities should not only adopt internal credit enhancement measures, but also take corresponding external credit enhancement measures as needed to ensure investor returns. In addition, M Small Loan Company should further improve its liquidity plan for asset-backed securities and reduce corresponding liquidity risks.
