# 摘要

近年来，资产证券化作为一种创新的融资渠道，在融资租赁行业得到了广泛应用。它不仅能有效解决融资难题，还有助于提升资金使用效率，为投资者提供了一种新的投资选择。然而资产证券化本身是一把“双刃剑”，即使融资租赁证券化可以一定程度上帮助企业解决融资难问题，但发行证券化产品涉及的众多风险也不容忽视。

本文在融资租赁资产证券化风险管理的研究背景、意义以及相关理论的基础上，选取“诚通租赁央企第2 期资产支持专项计划”为研究对象，先对案例中该产品的原始权益人、产品要素、基础资产池及交易结构进行了详细介绍，将产品设计到运营的过程划分成基础资产构成阶段、交易结构设计阶段和存续阶段三个阶段，识别和评估每一阶段中的风险，然后根据对于评估后的风险采取的控制措施，结合融资租赁行业现状，总结本案例的风险管理经验，通过不足之处，提出企业进行融资租赁资产证券化各个阶段风险的防控建议。

最终，通过总结本案例风险管理的过程，得出构建高信誉的基础资产，引入丰富的内外部信用增级方式，展开背景调查选择可靠的外部增信主体以及持续关注参与主体的履约能力，为促进融资租赁资产证券化风险管理提供了有益的经验启示。同时，针对案例的风险管理过程中外部措施较难降低基础资产集中度高的风险、原始权益人信息披露不完全导致信用风险上升、评评级机构公信力不足无法降低信用评级风险等问题，提出以下风险管理建议：第一，注重基础资产池分散程度，丰富底层资产；第二，完善底层资产信息披露，强化尽职调查；第三，规范信用评级机构，发展再评级市场；第四，提升自身的风险管理能力，健全风险管理体系。通过进行融资租赁资产证券化风险管理的案例研究，改善产品发行质量后，可以有效提升证券的信用等级、降低融资成本、实现风险隔离，促进融资租赁自资产证券化更好地发展。

# ABSTRACT

In recent years, asset securitization has been widely used as an innovative financing channel in the leasing industry. It not only effectively solves financing difficulties, but also helps to improve the efficiency of fund utilization, providing investors with a new investment choice. However, asset securitization itself is a double-edged sword. Even though leasing securitization can help enterprises solve financing difficulties to a certain extent, the numerous risks involved in issuing securitization products cannot be ignored.

Based on the research background, significance, and relevant theories of risk management in the securitization of financing lease assets, this article selects the "Chengtong Leasing Central Enterprise Phase 2 Asset Support Special Plan" as the research object. Firstly, a detailed introduction is given to the original equity holders, product elements, basic asset pool, and transaction structure of the product in the case. The process from product design to operation is divided into three stages: basic asset composition stage, transaction structure design stage, and survival stage. The risks in each stage are identified and evaluated. Then, based on the control measures taken for the evaluated risks and the current situation of the financing lease industry, the risk management experience of this case is summarized. Through the shortcomings, suggestions for risk prevention and control in each stage of financing lease asset securitization for enterprises are proposed.

Finally, by summarizing the process of risk management in this case, it is concluded that building a high reputation basic asset, introducing rich internal and external credit enhancement methods, conducting background checks to select reliable external credit enhancement entities, and continuously monitoring the performance ability of participating entities provide useful experience and inspiration for promoting the risk management of financing lease asset securitization. At the same time, in response to the difficulties of external measures in reducing the risk of high concentration of underlying assets in the risk management process of the case, incomplete disclosure of information by original equity holders leading to an increase in credit risk, and insufficient credibility of rating agencies unable to reduce credit rating risk, the following risk management suggestions are proposed: first, focus on the degree of diversification of the underlying asset pool and enrich the underlying assets; Secondly, improve the disclosure of underlying asset information and strengthen due diligence; Thirdly, standardize credit rating agencies and develop the re rating market; Fourthly, enhance one's own risk management capabilities and establish a sound risk management system. By conducting case studies on risk management of asset securitization through financing leases, improving the quality of product issuance can effectively enhance the credit rating of securities, reduce financing costs, achieve risk isolation, and promote the better development of asset securitization through financing leases.
