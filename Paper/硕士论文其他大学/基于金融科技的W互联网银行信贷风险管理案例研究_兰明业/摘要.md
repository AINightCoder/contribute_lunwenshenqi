# 摘 要

近年来，随着科技水平的提高以及金融水平、经济水平的发展，金融科技逐渐受到国家以及各商业银行的重视。金融科技包括：大数据、区块链、人工智能、云计算等，其与金融行业契合度较高。其中，如何将金融科技融入到信贷业务风险管理中被各界广泛关注与讨论。

论文在了解相关金融科技技术以及商业银行信贷风险管理的文献的基础上，基于信息不对称、大数据风险控制、长尾理论，对金融科技如何融入信贷业务风险管理以及应用中还存在哪些问题进行研究。论文选取W 银行作为研究对象，这是我国第一家互联网银行，其金融科技发展水平与信贷风险控制效果均处于业内领先水平，具有一定代表性。在案例分析研究过程中，首先利用具体案例以及相关报表数据对W 银行金融科技发展状况、基于金融科技的风险管理现状进行介绍。其次，选取 W 银行针对个人用户产品“微粒贷”以及针对小微企业产品“微业贷”为分析对象，从贷前、贷中、贷后以及风险识别、风险评估、风险控制角度结合进行梳理，分析其如何在信贷风险管理过程中应用金融科技。例如：贷前阶段基于大数据技术与区块链技术进行风险识别、贷中阶段构建区块链网络确保数据安全完整以实现风险控制、贷后阶段基于大数据技术、人工智能进行智能催收以实现风险控制。接着据此结合信贷相关指标，横向、纵向对 W 银行信贷业务中金融科技应用效果进行分析，通过对上述风险管理流程分析归纳得出 W 银行在风险管理中的先进做法：金融科技技术为贷款审批提供量化决策建议、运用金融科技精准识别潜在客户、基于区块链技术建立数据共享网络、提供多渠道贷款催收方式。但其在应用过程中也存在一定缺陷，如贷前阶段信用评级数据类型受限、贷中阶段大数据风控安全存在隐患、贷后阶段贷款用途跟踪管理不足等问题，并针对上述问题提出相应的优化建议。

通过全面的分析 W 银行利用金融科技防范和管理信贷风险的能力，来说明金融科技能提高我国银行业信贷风险管理水平并得出我国商业银行该如何运用金融科技进行信贷业务风险管理的启示。包括：建立智能化信用评级系统、与金融科技企业展开合作、优化信贷风险管理模型、构建金融科技人才风控团队、自建金融科技子公司。探讨互联网银行在金融科技领域的发展及其信贷风险管理的独特性，深入分析金融科技如何影响银行的信贷风险管理，该研究对于促进普惠金融的发展以及保障金融市场的稳定性与安全性，具有重要的实际意义。

# ABSTRACT

In recent years, with the improvement of scientific and technological level and the development of financial level and economic development level, financial technology has gradually attracted the attention of the state and commercial banks. Fintech includes: big data, blockchain, artificial intelligence, cloud computing, etc., which has a high degree of fit with the financial industry. Among them, how to integrate financial technology into the risk management of credit business has been widely concerned and discussed.

On the basis of understanding related literatures on financial technology and credit risk management of commercial banks, and based on information asymmetry, big data risk control and long tail theory, this paper studies how to integrate financial technology into credit business risk management and what problems still exist in its application. This paper chooses W Bank as the research object, which is the first Internet bank in China, and its fintech development level and credit risk control effect are both at the leading level in the industry, which is representative to a certain extent. In the process of case analysis and study, specific cases and relevant report data were first used to introduce the development status of financial technology and the status quo of risk management based on financial technology in Bank W. Secondly, Bank W's product "Micro Loan" for individual users and "Micro industry loan" for small and micro enterprises are selected as the analysis objects, and analyzed from the perspectives of pre-loan, mid-loan, post-loan, risk identification, risk assessment and risk control, and how to apply fintech in the credit risk management process. For example, in the pre-loan stage, risk identification is carried out based on big data technology and blockchain technology; in the mid-loan stage, blockchain network is built to ensure data security and integrity to achieve risk control; in the post-loan stage, intelligent collection is carried out based on big data technology and artificial intelligence to achieve risk control. Then, based on this, combined with credit-related indicators, the paper analyzes the application effect of fintech in the credit business of W Bank horizontally and vertically, and concludes the advanced practices of W Bank in risk management through the analysis of the above risk management process: Fintech technology provides quantitative decision-making suggestions for loan approval, uses fintech to achieve accurate customer acquisition, establishes a data sharing network based on blockchain technology, and provides multi-channel loan collction methods. However, it also has some defects in the application process, such as insufficient data financial attributes, hidden dangers in data security, insufficient loan purpose tracking management and other problems, and put forward corresponding optimization suggestions for the above problems.

Through a comprehensive analysis of the ability of W bank to use financial technology to prevent and manage credit risks, this paper explains that financial technology can improve the credit risk management level of Chinese banks and gives the enlightenment of how Chinese commercial banks can use financial technology for credit business risk management. Including: using big data to establish a credit rating system, building a financial technology talent risk control team, and establishing their own financial technology subsidiaries. Exploring the development of internet banking in the field of financial technology , this study delves into how financial technology impacts banks' management of credit risk. Such research is of significant practical importance for promoting the development of inclusive finance and ensuring the stability and security of the financial market.
