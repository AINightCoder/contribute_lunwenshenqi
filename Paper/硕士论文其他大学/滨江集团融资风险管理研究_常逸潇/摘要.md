# 滨江集团融资风险管理研究

# 摘要

近年来，随着房地产行业供给与需求双向的政策调整，目前住房政策已从2020年的“趋紧”到2021年的“从严”慢慢到2023、2024年的“趋松”与“维稳”。这一阶段的主要目标为防风险与促消费，在供给端防范化解优质房地产企业的风险，改善资产负债状况，防止无序扩张，促进房地产企业平稳发展，在需求端加大财税需求支持加快恢复和提振消费。经历了“三道红线”阵痛的房地产行业逐渐由高杠杆、高周转的模式走向重质量发展，在当前的政策利好下，房地产企业需紧随政策引导，随着“金融十六条”、“认房不认贷”等政策不断落地，房地产企业如何融资、拓展业务以抓住当前的市场尤为重要。融资需求量不断提高随之而来的就是融资风险也会上升，为房地产企业完善现有的风险管理体系可以为房地产企业的发展保驾护航，更好地响应国家的政策，同时也可以为居民购房提供保障。

基于以上背景，本文选取滨江集团的融资风险管理作为研究内容，将论文分为六章：第一章阐述该选题的研究背景与研究意义，归纳了国内外的融资风险管理的方式。第二章介绍了文章涉及的理论，主要涉及风险管理理论、优序融资理论与资本成本理论，为后续研究滨江集团融资风险的不足与优化方法打下理论基础。第三章介绍了房地产行业的特征、主要融资渠道、渠道面临的风险与风险管理流程。第四章基于风险识别、评估、控制三方面分析滨江集团融资风险管理的问题。第五章基于分析出的问题提出优化方案。第六章为本文得出的结论与研究不足。通过研究发现滨江集团融资风险管理在风险识别方面需加强对非财务指标的关注，在风险评估方面需建立定性与定量结合的风险评估体系，在风险控制方面需完善组织架构，丰富融资渠道以及加大风控技术研发投入。针对以上不足提出对策，希望可以为完善滨江集团融资风险管理提供参考。
