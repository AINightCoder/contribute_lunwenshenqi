# 摘要

近年来，随着大数据的兴起和信息技术的飞速进步，互联网已逐渐融入人们的日常生活，在线购物变得不可或缺。在经济新常态下，电商企业作为一种新业态凭借其成本低、效率高、覆盖面广和方便快捷的特点得到快速发展，成为我国经济增长、提供就业机会和促进消费的关键力量。我国对电商企业的成长给予了极高的关注，并实施了一系列有益于电商企业发展的政策。随着电商企业的快速增长，它们也面临着众多的挑战。由于这些挑战与传统的经营和管理方式有很大的不同，许多电商企业在面对财务风险时难以做出有效地应对和控制。财务风险是企业面临的一个重大问题，一旦爆发将导致整个企业的衰败和倒闭。因此，对于电商企业来说，准确地识别财务风险、进行客观的风险评估并实施有力的风险控制策略变得尤其关键。

本文以电商行业为研究背景，选择被称为“电商黑马”的拼多多为对象展开研究。拼多多从鲜为人知的小应用成为电商行业的领军者，其发展速度令人震惊，这说明拼多多有它的独特之处，值得去进行深入的研究和分析。本文首先基于国内外的研究成果，详细介绍了财务风险及其相关的理论知识。随后，深入探讨了电商行业的当前发展状况，并对拼多多的历史和现状进行了简要总结。通过对拼多多进行横向和纵向的财务风险识别，建立财务指标评价体系，利用 Pearson 相关性分析进行指标的筛选，在计算了熵值法的权重后，结合功效系数法对拼多多的财务风险进行了评估，得出结论拼多多近五年财务状况逐步向好，但仍存在一些财务风险。接着深入探讨了其财务风险的成因，结合拼多多特点提出一系列对策，如把控产品质量、扩大收入来源，建设物流体系等，以帮助企业更好地规避财务风险。希望能够为电商企业财务风险管理提供有益的方法与参考，给其他电商企业带来启示，在一定程度上促进整个电商行业蓬勃发展。

# Research on Financial Risk Management of E-commerce Enterprise:A Case Study of Pinduoduo

# Abstract

In recent years, with the rise of big data and the rapid progress of information technology, the Internet has gradually integrated into people's daily life, and online shopping has become indispensable. Under the new normal of the economy, e-commerce enterprises, as a new form of business, have developed rapidly with their low cost, high efficiency, wide coverage and convenient and fast characteristics, and have become a key force in China's economic growth, providing employment opportunities and promoting consumption. China has paid great atention to the growth of e-commerce enterprises and implemented a series of policies that are beneficial to the development of e-commerce enterprises. With the rapid growth of e-commerce companies, they also face numerous challenges. Because these challenges are very different from traditional operations and management methods, many e-commerce companies struggle to effectively respond to and control financial risks. Financial risk is a major problem faced by enterprises, and once it erupts, it will lead to the decline and closure of the entire enterprise. Therefore, it is especially critical for e-commerce companies to accurately identify financial risks, conduct objective risk assessments, and implement strong risk control strategies.

This paper takes the e-commerce industry as the research background and selects Pinduoduo, which is known as the "dark horse of e-commerce", as the object of research. Pinduoduo's astounding growth from a little-known app to a leader in the e-commerce industry shows that Pinduoduo has its own unique features that deserve in-depth research and analysis. Based on the research results at home and abroad, this paper introduces the theoretical knowledge of financial risk and its related knowledge in detail. Subsequently, the current development status of the e-commerce industry was discussed in depth, and the history and current situation of Pinduoduo were briefly summarized. By identifying the financial risks horizontally and vertically of Pinduoduo, establishing a financial index evaluation system, using Pearson correlation analysis to screen the indicators, calculating the weight of the entropy method, and evaluating the financial risks of Pinduoduo in combination with the efficacy coeficient method, it is concluded that Pinduoduo's financial situation has gradually improved in the past five years, but there are still some financial risks. Then, the causes of its financial risks are discussed in depth, and a series of countermeasures are put forward based on the characteristics of Pinduoduo, such as controlling product quality, expanding revenue sources, and building a logistics system, so as to help enterprises better avoid financial risks. It is hoped that it can provide useful methods and references for the financial risk management of e-commerce enterprises, bring inspiration to other e-commerce enterprises, and promote the vigorous development of the entire e-commerce industry to a certain extent.
