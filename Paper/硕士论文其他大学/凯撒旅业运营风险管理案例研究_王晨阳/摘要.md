# 摘要

旅游业是我国支柱产业和经济增长点，产业增加值年均增速 $6 . 2 4 \%$ 。《“十四五”旅游业发展规划》提出推动文化和旅游融合、完善旅游业体系等目标。疫情防控放开后，2023 年国内旅游总人次和总花费大幅增长，旅游业复苏强劲，但旅游业也面临高风险，旅游产品的综合性和敏感性增加企业运营的不确定性，加强旅游业运营风险管理，预防风险、减少损失，恢复正常运营至关重要。

本文选取凯撒同盛发展股份有限公司为研究案例，通过文献研究法、案例分析法、层次分析法对案例企业运营风险管理进行研究。首先，通过文献研究法，从风险管理相关理论、旅游行业特点及风险影响因素、旅游行业运营风险管理问题及优化三个方面对国内外文献进行梳理，以了解当前的旅游行业运营风险管理现状。并以此为基础总结旅游企业运营特点、运营风险影响因素及政策要求。其次，通过案例研究法，根据总结的运营风险影响因素，以及凯撒旅业实际情况，对凯撒旅业运营风险管理问题进行研究分析，研究发现公司在组织架构、人力资源、信息系统、采购付款、突发事件等方面存在风险管理问题。之后基于发现的问题，提出相应的运营风险管理对策，其中针对缺少运营风险管理评估体系问题，通过运用层次分析法来确定构建指标体系的权重，来确定风险的重要程度。最后对整个研究过程进行了总结与展望。

本文深入探究典型案例的运营风险管理问题，并提出相应的运营风险管理问题对策，不仅有利于案例企业完善运营风险管理，还能够给予同行业其他企业一定的经验借鉴。

# Operational Risk Management Case Studies of Caissa Tourism

# Abstract

Tourism is a pillar industry and economic growth point in China, with an average annual growth rate of 6.24 per cent in value added. The 14th Five-Year Plan for Tourism Development puts forward goals such as promoting the integration of culture and tourism and improving the tourism system. After the liberalization of epidemic prevention and control, Significant increase in total domestic tourism arrivals and total spending by 2023, and the tourism industry recovered strongly, but the tourism industry is also facing high risks, and the comprehensiveness and sensitivity of the tourism products increase the uncertainty of the business operations, so it is crucial to strengthen the risk management of the tourism industry operations to prevent risks, reduce losses, and restore normal operations.

In this paper, Caesar Tongsheng Development Co., Ltd. is selected as a research case, and the operational risk management of the case companies is studied through literature research method, case study method and hierarchical analysis method.First of all, through the literature research method, the domestic and foreign literature is sorted out from three aspects: risk management related theories, tourism industry characteristics and risk influencing factors, and operation risk management problems and optimization in the tourism industry, in order to understand the current status of operation risk management in the tourism industry. And on the basis of this, we summarize the operational characteristics, operational risk influencing factors and policy requirements of tourism enterprises. Secondly, through the case study method, based on the summarized operational risk influencing factors and the actual situation of Caesar's tourism industry, Caesar's tourism industry operational risk management problems are studied and analyzed, and the study finds that there are risk management problems in the company in terms of organizational structure, human resources, information system, procurement and payment, and emergencies, and so on. Afterwards, based on the problems found, corresponding operational risk management countermeasures are proposed, in which the lack of operational risk management assessment system is addressed, and the weights of the index system are determined by applying the hierarchical analysis method to determine the degree of importance of the risks. Finally, the whole research process is summarized and prospected.

This paper explores the operation risk management problems of typical cases and puts forward corresponding operation risk management countermeasures, which is not only conducive to the improvement of operation risk management of the case enterprise, but also can give other enterprises in the same industry a certain experience to learn from.
