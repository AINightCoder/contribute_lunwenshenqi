# 摘要

电子商务平台中的客户信用风险管理是行业性难题，其管理水平将对平台竞争力产生重要影响。本文针对电子商务企业客户信用风险管理问题，以A平台电商为例，对其在客户信用风险管理进行了系统调研分析。梳理出了该平台客户信用风险管理方面的现状与问题，又对行业代表性电商平台的相关经验做了调研，从而对A平台和电子商务行业提出了以提升客户信用风险管理能力为核心，建设全面、科学的客户信用风险管理体系的改进建议。

研究指出，随着电子商务购买需求的不断增长以及新一代信息技术的迅速崛起，传统的客户信用风险管理手段已难以适应电子商务平台的发展需求。A平台现阶段的客户信用风险管理水平难以支撑其战略目标和业务需求，存在客户信用风险管理体系不健全、客户信用风险评估能力不足和评估结果应用不足等问题。A平台需要依托数字化建设，构建以客户信用风险管理为导向、以增加客户服务价值为目标、以完善客户治理为目的的新型客户信用风险管理模式。通过加强客户信用风险管理体系建设，构建智慧客户信用风险管理体系；通过完善数字化客户信用风险评估体系，建立数字化、标准化的客户信用风险评估流程，实现全流程信用风险评估与应用。

本文基于对A平台和行业代表性平台的调研分析，得出了电子商务行业在客户信用风险管理的几点启示：电子商务平台需要积极构建行业信用文化、加强行业信用信息共享与联动、构建智慧管理体系和建立全流程客户信用风险评估体系，以实现促进整体信用环境建设、加速行业良性发展的目标。

# Research on improving the credit risk management ability of E-commerce enterprise customers -- taking Company A

# Abstract

Customer credit risk management in e-commerce platforms is an industry-wide challenge, and its management level has a significant impact on the competitiveness of the platform. This paper focuses on the issue of customer credit risk management in e-commerce enterprises, taking platform A as an example, and conducts a systematic investigation and analysis of its customer credit risk management. The current status and issues of the platform's customer credit risk management are identified, and the relevant experiences of representative e-commerce platforms in the industry are investigated. Consequently, suggestions are proposed to improve the comprehensive and scientific customer credit risk management system centered on enhancing the capability of customer credit risk management for platform A and the e-commerce industry.

The research points out that with the continuous growth of e-commerce purchasing demand and the rapid rise of new-generation information technology, traditional customer credit risk management methods have become difficult to meet the development needs of e-commerce platforms. The current level of customer credit risk management on platform A is insufficient to support its strategic goals and business needs, with issues such as an incomplete customer credit risk management system, insufficient customer credit risk assessment capabilities, and insufficient application of assessment results. Platform A needs to rely on digital construction to build a new customer credit risk management model oriented by customer credit risk management, aimed at increasing customer service value, and aimed at improving customer governance. By strengthening the construction of customer credit risk management systems, a smart customer credit risk management system should be established. By improving the digital customer credit risk assessment system, a digitalized and standardized customer credit risk assessment process should be established to achieve full-process credit risk assessment and application.

Based on the investigation and analysis of platform A and representative industry platforms, this paper draws several insights for the e-commerce industry in customer credit risk management: e-commerce platforms need to actively build an industry credit culture, strengthen industry credit information sharing and collaboration, establish a smart management system, and establish a full-process customer credit risk assessment system to promote the overall credit environment construction and accelerate the healthy development of the industry.
