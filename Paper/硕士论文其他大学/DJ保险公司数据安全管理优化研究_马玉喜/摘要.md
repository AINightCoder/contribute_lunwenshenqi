# 保险公司数据安全管理优化研究

# 摘要

随着信息化程度的提高，保险公司越来越依赖信息系统来存储和管理大量客户数据。然而，保险数据的敏感性和重要性使得保险公司成为黑客恶意攻击的目标。因此，本文以DJ保险公司数据安全为研究对象，以期探寻其存在的问题并提出优化策略。

本文通过访谈的方式对DJ保险公司信息科技部门管理人员和科技一线人员进行了调研。对DJ保险公司的基本情况，包括公司的历史和规模，以及数据安全管理现状进行分析，发现DJ公司所面临的主要数据安全风险为数据丢失、数据篡改和数据泄露等。据此，本文根据 DSMM 数据安全能力成熟度模型对DJ保险公司的数据安全能力进行了全面评价。首先，确定了评价对象为公共服务核心系统。其次，依据 DSMM 模型的评价方法，制定了针对DJ保险公司数据安全能力成熟度的评价调研问卷。最后，选择发放调研问卷主要对象是DJ保险公司科技、业务管理者及一线技术人员。通过获取与DJ保险公司数据安全管理工作接触最多的人员评价，以期找出DJ 保险公司数据安全管理方面的共性问题。

通过上述调研，分析出 DJ保险公司在数据安全方面存在数据采集组织架构不健全、数据存储流程制度不完善、数据处理技术应用待提高、数据交换人员能力不充分等问题；在数据安全风控方面存在决策效率低下、风险管理不当、核心技术落后、合规性风险高等问题。

本文根据上述数据安全管理问题，通过木桶原理给出数据安全管理优化策略的基本原则是识别数据安全管理短板并采取措施加以改进，以提升整体的数据安全管理水平；通过 SWOT 矩阵分析出 DJ 保险公司在数据安全管方面的优势、劣势、风险和机会，采用 ST战略提出了DJ保险公司数据安全管理的优化策略为构建数据安全组织架构、完善数据安全管理体系、提高数据安全技术使用、提升数据处理人员能力；并提出了优化策略的实施保障措施为提升员工数据安全意识、强化部门之间协同合作、增加技术研发投入、加强员工培训考核。

With the improvement of informatization, insurance companies increasingly rely on information systems to store and manage large amounts of customer data. However, the sensitivity and importance of insurance data makes insurance companies a target for malicious attacks by hackers. Therefore, this paper takes the data security of DJ insurance company as the research object, in order to explore the existing problems and put forward optimization strategies.

In this paper, the managers and front-line staff of information technology department of DJ Insurance Company were investigated through investigation and interview. By analyzing the basic situation of DJ insurance company, including the history and scale of the company, as well as the current situation of data security management, it is found that the main data security risks faced by DJ company are data loss, data tampering and data leakage. According to the data security capability maturity model of DSMM, the data security capability of DJ Insurance company is evaluated comprehensively. First, the evaluation object is identified as the core system of public service. Secondly, according to the evaluation method of DSMM model, a questionnaire was developed to evaluate the maturity of data security capability of DJ insurance company. Finally, the main objects of the questionnaire are the technology, business managers and front-line technical personnel of DJ Insurance Company. By obtaining the evaluation of the personnel who have the most contact with the data security management of DJ Insurance company, we hope to find out the common problems of data security management of DJ Insurance company.

Through the above research, it is analyzed that DJ insurance company has problems in data security, such as imperfect organizational structure of data collection, imperfect system of data storage process, application of data processing technology to be improved, and insufficient ability of data exchange personnel. In terms of data security risk control, there are some problems such as low decision-making efficiency, improper risk management, backward core technology and high compliance risk.

In this paper, according to the above data security management problems, the basic principle of data security management optimization strategy is to identify the shortcomings of data security management and take measures to improve it, so as to enhance the overall data security management level; The advantages, disadvantages, risks and opportunities of DJ Insurance company in data security management are analyzed through SWOT matrix, and the optimization strategy of data security management of DJ Insurance company is put forward by adopting ST strategy, which is to build data security organization structure, improve data security management system, improve the use of data security technology, and enhance the ability of data processing personnel. It also puts forward the safeguard measures for the implementation of the optimization strategy to enhance the awareness of data security of employees, strengthen the cooperation between departments, increase the investment in technology research and development, and strengthen the training and assessment of employees.
